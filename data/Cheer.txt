Keep going – even the best programmers started out writing 'Hello World'!
Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer.
Code never lies, comments sometimes do.
First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.
Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
The best error message is the one that never shows up.
Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.
Make it work, make it right, make it fast.
Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements.
